ENG2077 Engineering Skills 2 – CAD: Mountain Board project 
Module leaders: Bruce Gregg, Jacob Young  Ewan Bremner 
Brief: 
Using   provided components, the concept   images   in this   brief (Appendix   1 and 2),   and your   own   creative design, create a “digital twin”   model of a   Mountainboard in   Fusion. Then,   generate   technical   drawings   to   assist   with the   manufacturing and assembly of your   Mountainboard   in compliance with   BS8888 standards.

If you already have an Autodesk account from your previous year, you may be asked to renew your educational licence. Check your student email for a warning about this. Follow the instructions provided and select the 1-year student licence. 
For full   Fusion   installation guidance and first time   log in, please   refer to the   “Fusion   Installation   Guidance”   on   Moodle.Fusion   uses a cloud-based file system which means you   can   log   in   and   access your files   from   any   machine with   Fusion installed. There are computer labs   throughout the   University   and   Library   with   Fusion   installed for   your   benefit.
Method: 
This   is a self-led, online video course where you are   expected to   schedule your   own   learning   to   meet   the   summative assignment deadline.
Complete the video training course in the   Mountainboard   Project section of the   ENG2077   Moodle.
Following the recommended schedule specified   in the   introductory   lecture slides will   result   in you   completing   the assignment early with time to   review and refine your work,   and finish   the   assignment well   clear   of the   exam   period.
Using the techniques you have learned, along with the   downloadable   parts   and   components   list   guidance,   create   a   3D   model   of   the   assembly   shown   in   appendix   1   and   2.
Generate a part drawing displaying key   dimensions   and   details   of your deck or base   plate,   along with   general   assembly drawings, and appropriate exploded view drawings   containing   a   Bill   of   Materials.
Submission requirements: 
-             You   must   submit   an “ .f3d”   Fusion   file   containing   your   3D   model.
-             You   must   submit   an “ .doc” word   file   containing   a   Fusion   shareable   link.
-             You   must submit “.pdf” technical drawings   including   a   General Assembly   drawing,   appropriate   exploded view with   BOM drawings, and a   part drawing of your deck or   base   plate   component.
-               To be submitted   via   Moodle.
Submission deadlines: 
-             A   final “summative” submission   at   the   end   of   Semester   1,   which   is   graded.
The deadline date 代 写ENG2077 Engineering Skills 2 – CAD: Mountain Board projectC/C++

Training materials: 
All   training   materials   are   hosted   on   the   ENG2077   Moodle   portal.
(Note: Some buttons or instructions maybe inaccurate due to rapid version changes in the software. If anything is unclear, please contact us at the email address below.) 
The practise tutorial   is a five-part video series that covers   everything   you   need to   guide   you   towards   building   your own   mountainboard.
There is a   University of Glasgow branded, technical   drawing   template   inside   the   file   called   “   Mountainboard   Project   Downloads.zip” found in the section titled “   Mountainboard   Project –   Download   Materials”   . This   is also   where you can access the   pre-provided   Mountainboard components.   Download the files and   extract   the contents. The video course will give you   instructions on how   to   use   these   files.If you   intend to use your own personal device to   complete this   task,   please   install   and/or   test   the   software before watching the videos. Alternatively, the   University   provides computer labs with   Fusion   pre-installed,   simply   log in with your Autodesk credentials.
Do not put yourself in a   position where you think   your   personal   device   will   work with   Fusion   only   to   discover   a   technical problem.   Personal device failure is   not considered “Good   cause” for failing   to   complete   your work.
Test your personal devices or do not use them. 
Learning outcomes: 
-             Develop a   model through   the   CAD   generation   portion   of a   design   process
-             Create   part   components   using   CAE   software
-             Create sub-assemblies and   assemblies   using   CAE   software
-             Understand the   concept of a “top-down” modelling   approach
-             Create technical drawings   using   CAE software,   understand their   purpose,   how   they   function   and   how   to create them   effectively.
How this is graded: 
This   is   a   pass   / fail   module, graded   out   of   100. The   pass   / fail   threshold   is   50.
The submitted   model   must   be assembled as   per the concept   images   in appendix   1 and   2,   with   mostly   accurate   joints and   motions.
You   must   produce a deck component of your own design and   creativity, while   still   being   realistic for manufacture, assembly, and riding. We will check the   design timelines   to   ensure   your   deck   is   self-produced.
There must be a minimum   of three distinct   technical   drawings   submitted,   in   accordance with   the   submission   requirements.
The marking focus will   be split across   both your inputs   (3D   model)   and   outputs   (technical   drawings).
What we are looking for is for you to start   producing   CAD   models   that   represent   a   digital   twin   of the   physical   product,   including all necessary off-the-shelf nuts, bolts,   bearings   etc.,   and   produce   accurate   joint   motions. Can you create a 3D CAD   model to   a   required   specification,   and   can you   communicate   it   effectively   via technical drawings, in compliance with   British standards?
